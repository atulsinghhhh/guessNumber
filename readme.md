"Guess the Number Game (Low-Level Programming)"
This is the first game I developed using low-level programming concepts. 
I leveraged resources from GeeksforGeeks and ChatGPT to help build the logic and structure. 
Special thanks to my Bhaiya, Saurabh, who guided me and emphasized the importance of mastering the C programming language, 
making this project a reality.
